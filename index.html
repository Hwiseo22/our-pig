  <h2>About our pig</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>First, his name is <strong>Isuck</strong> and his last name is <strong>Lin</strong>.</li>
    <li>He's slow because he's too <strong>fat</strong> <strong>(LOL!)</strong></li>
    <li>Isuck was born in China, but he looks like an alien.</li>
    <li>Isuck is strong... but not really. He just looks strong because of his <strong>flesh</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If he knew who I was, I'd probably die for him. But I'm sure he doesn't know who I am. LOL LOL LOL HA! HA!</p>
  <p>I think it's perfect! Did you like it? I hope you did!</p>
